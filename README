welcome to neuropil
===================

1) required installations

mandatory:
libsodium - crypto library

optional:
criterion - test suite framework
sphinx - python documentation building
scons - python build tool


2) building the library and example programs

preferred method of building is scons.
build in debug mode: 
	
	scons debug=1

build in release mode: 

	scons release=1

build the documentation (sphinx installation required): 
	
	scons doc=1

clean the project:

	scons -c
	
there is also a Makefile available, but some path infos are hard coded, sorry.
the Makefile is mainly used to run the llvm scan-build tooling for a static code analysis

no autoconf or cmake available until now, to be done

3) directory structure

input directories:
 - src - c source code
 - test - c test source code
 - include - c header files
 - lib - used as a third party library directory
 - doc - sphinx documentation source files

output directories:
 - build - library, object files and documentation
 - bin - example executables and test suite

4) running the programs

you can run the executables just as any executable, please have a look at the parameters
of each program:

example 1: run the controller on port 1111

	./bin/neuropil_controller -b 1111 

example 2: run a node on port 2222 and send a join message to another node:

	./bin/neuropil_node -b 2222 -j b3b680a867849efe5886a5db751392e9d3079779e3f3c240ed849c11f4ba7d4a:udp6:test.local:3141 

to run the test suites please us the parameter "-j1" to limit parallel execution
usually we use the following command:

	./bin/neuropil_test_suite --tap -j1
