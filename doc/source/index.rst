===============================================================================
Welcome to neuropil !
===============================================================================

neuropil is a small c-library which by default adds two layers of encryption to communication channels.
It allows you to address identities (a device, an application, a service or a person) worldwide without compromise 
for privacy or security requirements. 

The project embraces modern concepts like named-data networks, self-sovereign 
identities, zero trust architectures and attributes based access control to increase the cybersecurity level of it's 
users beyond the current state-of-technology. In effect its users will benefit from the new way of secure, scalable 
and souvereign data integration to easily comply with legal, organizational, operational and compliance regulations 
and requirements.
