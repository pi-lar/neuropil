.. _protocol_token_structure:

Token in general
****************

Within the neuropil library we us the aaatoken structure to fulfil authentication, authorization and accounting
purposes. The usage and meaning of each token for/in each sepcific case is ambigously and sometimes confusing (even
for us).

This chapter will try to add the neccessary details how tokens are used. Let us recall first how the token structure
is composed before diving into the details:

.. code-block:: c

   // depicts the protocol version used by a node / identity
   double version;

   // who is the owner
   char realm[64];
   // who issued this token
   char issuer[64];
   // what is this token about
   char subject[255];
   // who is the intended audience
   char audience[64];

   // token creation time
   double issued_at;
   // to be used at
   double not_before;
   // not to be used after
   double expires_at;
   // internal state of the token
   aaastate_type state;
   // uuid of this token
   char* uuid;

   // public key of this token
   unsigned char public_key[crypto_sign_PUBLICKEYBYTES];
   // private key of this token (not to be send over the wire
   unsigned char private_key[crypto_sign_SECRETKEYBYTES];

   // signature of the token
   unsigned char signature[crypto_sign_BYTES];

   // key/value attribute list
   np_tree_t* attributes;


One of the most important aspects is the use of the realm, issuer, subject and audience fields that interact with
each other and reference each other as the library build up its network structure. Therefore we will concentrate
on these four for the following chapter.


Protocol token format
*********************

.. note::
   The protocol token format is work in progress. please be aware of possible changes


A draft schematic format with 32‑byte rows. 
      
.. code-block:: c

   0              8              16             24
   |              |              |              |        (Bytes)

   |                           realm                           |  :

   |                                                           |  :
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+  v


In addition to specifying a layout we must define the format and semantics of the individual fields, for example:

 - `signature`
    64 bytes of signature, computed over all following bytes.

 - `public_key`
    32 bytes of public key material.

 - `realm, issuer, audience`
    32 bytes of digest, see `np_get_id` or `np_get_fingerprint`

 - `subject`
    the subject this toke is about. Should use `urn:` syntax style. (e.g. `urn:np:node:...` or `urn:np:id:...`)
    
 - `issued_at`, `not_before`, `expires_at`
    IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point numbers in big endian format (network byte order).

 - `version`
    The version of the neuropil library being used.

 - `attribute_length`
    Unsigned 64‑bit integer in big endian format.

 - `attributes`
    A variable length, MessagePack encoded map. No requirements on alignment.


Handshaking token
*****************

For the handshake we need to send some core informations to the other node, so the above mentioned fields will
contain:

.. code-block:: c

   realm         := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)>                              64
   issuer        := <empty> | <fingerprint(issuer)>                             64
   subject       := 'urn:np:node:<protocol>:<hostname>:<port>'                 255
   audience      := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)> | <fingerprint(issuer)>      64
   attributes    := { <session key for DHKE> }                                  64
   public_key    := <pk(node)>                                                  32
   signature     := <signature of above fields excluding attributes>            64
   signature_ext := <signature of all above fields>                             64
                                                                              -----
                                                                          max  666  bytes


Please remember that the main purpose here is to establish a secure conversation channel between any two nodes.
The cleartext hostname and port could also be found by doing a network scan. Furthermore we have to keep the token
size small to fit into the 1024 bytes bounds of our selected paket size. Only one paket as an initial handshake message
is allowed.

From the above structure you can create a node fingerprint (nfp), which is unique to this specific token.
This fingerprint again is used as the visible part of the :term:`DHT` which can be addressed.

  nfp = hash(nodetoken, signature)

similar we could create a handshake fingerprint (which we do not need, it is just here to complete the picture):

  hfp = hash(nodetoken, signature_ext)

A separate node token will be supplied in the join message to verify the use of a potential identity.


Join token
**********

The join message contains the token of the identity which is using a node. Identity token can be exported
and imported and are available in the userspace.

.. code-block:: c

   realm         := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)>                             64
   issuer        := <empty> | <fingerprint(issuer)>                            64
   subject       := 'urn:np:id:'<hash(userdata)>                              255
   audience      := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)> | <fingerprint(issuer)>     64
   attributes    := { _np.partner_fp: nfp, <?user supplied data> }            min 64
   public_key    := <pk(identity)>                                             32
   signature     := <signature of above fields excluding attributes>           64
   signature_ext := <signature of all above fields>                            64
                                                                              ----
                                                                          min 666


Again we can create a fingerprint of this token ('infp'). This fingerprint is not the same as the fingeprint of a
pure identity (ifp), as we do not know in advance which 'nfp' this idenity will use. A pure identity token of does
not contain the 'nfp'. But we can still calculate the fingeprint afterwards, because:

  ifp = hash(idtoken, signature)
  infp = hash(idtoken, signature_ext, nfp)

all signatures can be validated using the public keys of tokens that have been received.

'nfp' potentially contains the issuing fingerprint in the issuer field again. But if a technical node hosts more
than one identity, then the join message will also contain again the node token, this time in full length and
containing the required identity fingerprint:

.. code-block:: c

   realm         := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)>
   issuer        := <empty> | <fingerprint(issuer)>
   subject       := 'urn:np:node:<protocol>:<hostname>:<port>'
   audience      := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)> | <fingerprint(issuer)>
   attributes    := { <?identity: ifp>, <?user supplied data> }
   public_key    := <pk(node)>
   signature     := <signature of above fields excluding attributes>
   signature_ext := <signature of all above fields>


The second transmit of the node token is needed to certify that this identity is really running on this specific
node, a kind of automated cross-signing between node and identity. We could add the handshake fingerprint to this
token to make it really foolproof, but currently we do not think that it would be neccessary.

Please note that in the case of a pure technical node that should support the network we will only transmit the node
token again in the join message. The reason for doing so is the authentication callback, which is only triggered when
sending a join message.


Message intent token
********************

If an identity would like to exchange informations with another identity in the network, it sends out its message
intents, where we use token again.:

.. code-block:: c

   realm         := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)>
   issuer        := <ifp>
   subject       := 'urn:np:sub:'<hash(subject)>
   audience      := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)> | <fingerprint(issuer)>
   attributes    := { _np.partner_fp: nfp, <mx properties>, <?user supplied data> }
   public_key    := <pk(identity)>
   signature     := <signature of above fields excluding attributes>
   signature_ext := <signature of all above fields>


Please note that a message intent is somehow different, as you may get a message intent of an identity that your node
may not have any connection to. So first you need to authenticate the issuer of this message intent. you can
accomplish this by doing one of the three steps:

   - you implement a callback that is able to properly authenticate peers (e.g. using MerkleTree / Secure Remote
     Password / Shamirs shared secret schemes / ...)
   - you forward the recieved token to do the authn work for your node: either to your own realm, or to the realm set
     in the message intent, or you ask the partner fingerprint contained in the token whether the identity is really known
   - you do some sort of out-of-band deployment for know public idenity tokens. you could even use neuropil itself to
     inject a trusted public identity token into a device.

Once you know, that the recieved peer is the correct one, you do the second step and authorize the message exchange.
Again you have the three options above with the follwoing restriction to the second choice:

   - you forward the recieved token to do the authz work for your node to your own realm


PKI / Web of trust / zero knowledge setups
******************************************

Sometimes it is desirable to choose a pki setup for the tokens that you use. For this case the issuer field of the
token strutcure can be used. It indicates whether a token has been signed by another party. There is no pre-defined
setup for this kind of , but the usual setup as you know it from certificates is required. Especially you will have
to add your signature token to the attributes of an identity token.

One interesting feature of the neuropil message layer is the use of fingerprints as hash values, which are addressable
via the DHT. Without any further configuration we can exchange message intents with a realm or an issuer, and there
can be only one identity in the whole DHT which is able to create such identity or message intent tokens.

Therefore we (ourselves) favor the use of realms, because it lets you create 'online' registration instances without
pre-issuing and deploying public tokens. A fingerprint of an identity token is enough to identify the right partner or
to find a third party (realm) who is willing to proove the authenticity of a device, application or person.
In a similar way you can remote control your devices, because for authorization requests each device, application or
person is able to contact your realm for allowance.


The missing accounting tokens
*****************************

The chapters above have described the measures how you can authenticate and authorize token, but we have not yet
covered how you can use tokens for accounting purposes. But basically it is very easy.

An identity e.g. could create and send an accounting token for the messages and message intents it has recieved, just
by copying its own message intent

.. code-block:: c

   realm         := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)>
   issuer        := <ifp>
   subject       := 'urn:np:sub:'<hash(subject)>
   audience      := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)> | <fingerprint(issuer)>
   attributes    := { _np.partner_fp: nfp, <mx properties>, <?user supplied data> }
   public_key    := <pk(identity)>
   signature     := <signature of above fields excluding attributes>
   signature_ext := <signature of all above fields>


Under 'user supplied data' you can add any content, for example the message intents that you have received from your
peers, plus the actual usage of your/their token (it's a json structure). The main difference towards your initial
message intent token is the address that you're sending this token to.

Similar each node on the network can record received messages and

.. code-block:: c

   realm         := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)>
   issuer        := <nfp>
   subject       := 'urn:np:sub:'<hash(subject)>
   audience      := <empty> | <fingerprint(realm)> | <fingerprint(issuer)>
   attributes    := { _np.partner_fp: nfp, <mx properties>, <?user supplied data> }
   public_key    := <pk(identity)>
   signature     := <signature of above fields excluding attributes>
   signature_ext := <signature of all above fields>


in this case the section 'user supplied data' would contain the uuid of each message(part) that a single node has
received and forwarded. Most important are the nodes which do the message intent matching ! These nodes act as a
technical attesting notary that confirms the exchange of message intents. plus it could also confirm the abuse of
message intents.

Once an accounting token is ready it will be send to your own accounting realm (and this could be a different one
than your authn/authz realm), the token and it's contents can be analyzed and store in a database i.e. for
monitoring purposes. Once you put all distributed accounting tokens together, you will be able to see how your
messages have travelled through the :term:`DHT` (via the uuid).


Conclusion
**********

You can create arbitrary complex hierarchical token constructs and facilitate them in the way we have descibed them.
Please do not overdo it! Setting up a new realm and rejoining your devices and applications is easier than creating
complex pki hierarchies, and it can be done online ! Try this with certifates/pki and you know that you have fallen
into a trap ...
